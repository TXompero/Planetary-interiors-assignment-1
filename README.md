# Planetary interiors assignment 1
Planetary interiors assignment 1 code repository

The code presented here is related to model the interior of a planet, both with piece-wise constant density and density consistent with temperature and pressure changes. The code support both a convective layer and a constant density layer. A conductive layer is not yet developed however it should be straightforward to implement with the underlying structure. A python envirement with BurnMan is required to run the python script.
